# High-Accuracy Stock Price Predictor üìà

[![Accuracy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prediction_Accuracy-99.80%25-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Harsha-Sankarasetty/Stock_Prediction)

This project contains a sophisticated stock price prediction model that leverages a deep learning architecture to forecast future stock values with high accuracy. The core of this project is the `Stock_prediction.ipynb` notebook, which details the entire workflow from data preparation to model training, evaluation, and making future predictions.

The model successfully achieved a **99.80% prediction accuracy score** on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex patterns within financial time-series data.

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective of this project was to build and train a robust Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network capable of predicting the next period's stock price. The model uses a sequence of historical data, including price, volume, and technical indicators, to make its forecast.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern stack for data science and deep learning in Python:

* **Core Language**: **Python 3.x**
* **Data Manipulation**: **Pandas** & **NumPy**
* **Technical Analysis**: **Pandas-TA** (for generating technical indicators)
* **Deep Learning**: **TensorFlow** & **Keras**
* **Model Architecture**: **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
* **Data Preprocessing**: **Scikit-learn** (specifically `MinMaxScaler`)
* **Data Visualization**: **Matplotlib**
* **Development Environment**: **Jupyter Notebook**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The prediction process is broken down into several key stages within the notebook:

1.  **Data Loading & Preparation**: A feature-rich dataset containing historical stock data and technical indicators is loaded.
2.  **Feature Scaling**: All features and the target variable (stock price) are scaled to a range of (0, 1) using `MinMaxScaler`. This is a crucial step for optimizing the performance of LSTM networks.
3.  **Sequence Generation**: The data is transformed into sequences of a fixed length (e.g., 60 historical time steps) to be fed into the LSTM model.
4.  **Model Architecture**: A multi-layered LSTM model is constructed with `Dropout` layers to prevent overfitting. The model is designed to process the input sequences and output a single value representing the predicted next price.
5.  **Training & Evaluation**: The model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%. Performance is measured using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which is then converted into an intuitive accuracy score.
6.  **Prediction**: The trained model (`stock_predictor.h5`) is used to predict the stock price for the next time period based on the most recent sequence of data.

## üöÄ How to Run this Project

To run this notebook and replicate the results, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Harsha-Sankarasetty/Stock_Prediction.git](https://github.com/Harsha-Sankarasetty/Stock_Prediction.git)
    cd Stock_Prediction
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    *(You may need to rename your `Tech_Stack_Required` file to `requirements.txt`)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the `Stock_prediction.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.

    **Note**: Training a deep learning model is computationally intensive. It is recommended to use an environment with a **GPU**, like Google Colab, for faster training.

## üìä Results

The model's performance on the test data was excellent:

* **Prediction Accuracy Score**: **99.80%**
* **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: **0.20%**
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: **$0.89**

The low RMSE and MAPE values indicate that the model's predictions are very close to the actual stock prices.
